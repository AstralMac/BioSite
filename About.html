<h2>Who is Cydney?</h2>
<article>
    <p> An amazing mother, caring friend, wonderful wife, and talented artist, these are just a few things that describe who Cydney Boyce-Abdullah is. Born and raised in the City of St. Louis, MO. Cydney was born to Charlotte & Joel in October of 1994. In her earlier years, Cydney spent most of her time with her grandparents, where she developed a love for the art of film. Cydney and her grandmother would often be found bonding over a classic film. Especially the film “Grease” which is one of her all-time favorite films/musicals. Fast-forward to her grade school years, Cydney attended Wren Hollow Elementary School where she picked up the violin for the first time. Having just transferred from a different school, Cydney was behind the rest of her peers. But with some effort, practice, and talent she not only did she catch up to her peers. She surpassed them!  Moved from a beginner’s class to the 1st chair violinist in her symphonic orchestra class. Cydney displayed great passion and skill when playing the violin, which rewarded her with the experience of traveling the country to perform. Even performing in the magical attraction, Disney Land! Though Cydney doesn’t perform anymore she still loves to play from time to time. She also assists her daughter Audrey, who also plays violin in the same school Cydney attended! Cydney put a lot of her passions on hold to be an amazing mother to her daughter Audrey after she was born. But after 9 years of waiting, she is chasing her passion for film, having enrolled in the Digital Cinematography at Full Sail University. Cydney is using the passion she developed in her youth with her late grandmother to fuel her drive to achieve a film directing career after she graduates in 2026.</p>

    <p>Recently, Cydney’s grandmother passed away due to having Alzheimer’s disease. The loss of such an intelligent, strong, courageous, kind, and loving woman is a tragedy for anyone who knows her. Her grandmother was truly one of a kind. So, not wanting anyone else to experience this feeling of loss, Cydney greatly supports Cure Alzheimer’s Fund in finding a cure for this disease.</p>
