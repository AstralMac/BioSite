                <p> Cydney has always had a passion for the film industry.  Being a film buff since a young age, she would watch movies with her grandmother every chance she could! Using that passion as motivation Cydney is pursuing her Bachelor's degree in Digital Cinematography at Full Sail University; with plans of building a career as a director in film. But if you were to ask her, her greatest accomplishment is being a mother and having raised an amazing kid. </p>
